# IPL Win Predictor Application

## üåü Overview
The **IPL Win Predictor Application** is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the outcomes of IPL cricket matches. This project was undertaken as an exploration of machine learning workflows, data preprocessing techniques, and interactive web development.

While my primary objective wasn't driven by a deep interest in sports, this project served as a practical and insightful exercise to learn how machine learning concepts can be applied to real-world datasets. It combines **data analytics**, **predictive modeling**, and **visualization** to provide match insights.

## üìÅ Project Features
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Analyzed and preprocessed match datasets to engineer meaningful features such as:
     - Cumulative scores
     - Wickets out
     - overs remaining
     - Run rates (current and required)
   - Addressed data inconsistencies for improved model accuracy.

2. **Machine Learning Workflow**:
   - Built and trained predictive pipelines using algorithms:
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Designed the models to estimate win probabilities dynamically based on live match data.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Used **Matplotlib** to visualize:
     - Runs scored and wickets lost over time
     - Match progression details
   - Enabled clear and intuitive insights into match dynamics.

4. **Web Application**:
   - Developed an interactive interface using **Streamlit** to:
     - Allow users to input match data like runs left, balls left, and wickets.
     - Display win probabilities and match progressions in real-time.
   - Delivered a seamless and engaging user experience.
